- Javascript Runtime Environment
- It is used for *server* side programming
- *Nodejs is not a language, library or framework*

- It can run the code outside of the browser. (JS can run the code only in the browser because browsers have interpreter to run js code.) That's why Nodejs came in to market in 2009.
