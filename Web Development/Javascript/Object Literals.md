- Object literals are used to store keyed collections & complex entities. 
- Property => (key, value) pair
- Objects are a collection of properties
##### Syntax
```
const student = {
	name: "sanat",
	age: "21",
	marks: 94.4,
	city: "Bhubaneswar",
	interest: ["youtube","insta","linkedin"]
};

# In case of "const" student, the "const" ensures that the student object will remain constant. But we can change the value of that student object. Here constant means the memory address of the student object will remain same. 
```
### Creation of object literal for a Thread/Tweet

    username: "sanatkp_",
    content: "My first post",
    likes: 178,
