- Linear collection of things
- No need to create multiple variables to store multiple data, Using array we can store multiple data in single variable.
- Syntax : `let Students = ["aman","sanat","yash","samiran"]`
- Real life example ( In INSTAGRAM for our following and followers list there will be an array of followers/following with username )
- Example:
```
let Students = ["aman","sanat","samiran"];
Students[2];         //samiran

# Creation of an array

let info = ["aman",25,6.1];         //Mixed array
info[0][0]                          // 'a'

# For empty array creation

let newArr = [];
```

- To find length of an array we can do `arrName.length`
