1. Branching Strategies (BEFORE)
	- Master: We can't do git add and commit in master branch....it is a protected branch. (Production Environment)
	- Staging: All testings are done here. After passing the test it will send to the prod env or convert that staging branch into production/master.
	- Development: All developer will pick the code from there and they will make changes in it. developer will pull the code from this branch and edit the code in feature branch belonging from that development branch.
	(NOW)
	- MASTER: Prd
	- STAGING: stg
	- DEVELOPMENT: dev
		

2. VCS Revert/Reset

3. PR Merge/Branches Merge
